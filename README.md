My cousin is started a fund a little over a decade ago. He's raising money from inside our family so that eventually we can buy a Waverunner. So far he's raise just over $50.

Why do we need a Waverunner? I think this gif of Daniel Tosh trying to ride one says everything we need to say.

My cousin joked that I should create SamCoin and his fund would invest in it...

# SamCoin!

Features:
- ERC20 token
- 100,000,000 SamCoin minted at launch
- Wondering, like us, whether 100,000,000 will be worth enough to buy a Waverunner? We create an event called "Stimulus Package" that allows us to mint more tokens.

It doesn't make sense why anyone would want SamCoin, you ask? Well everything starts to make less sense when you start to poke holes in it so stop it.
