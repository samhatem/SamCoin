My cousin is started a fund a little over a decade ago. He's raising money from inside our family so that eventually we can buy a Waverunner. So far he's raise just over $50.

Why do we need a Waverunner? I think Daniel Tosh trying frown while on one says everything we need to say.

My cousin joked that I should create a SamCoin cryptocurrency and his fund would invest in it...

# SamCoin!

Features:
- ERC20 token
- 100,000,000 SamCoin minted at launch
- Wondering, like us, whether 100 million will be worth enough to buy a Waverunner? We create an proprietary event called "Stimulus Package" that allows us to mint more tokens!
- my cousin's fund doesn't even need to invest in it. We created value out of thin air instead!

It doesn't make sense why anyone would want SamCoin, you ask? Well everything starts to make less sense when you start to poke holes in it. Stop poking holes and start buying!

Fund our development and we will send you some SamCoin!\*: 0x80dAD562E9F9db3d81E612De9e623ce6DcEF0516

\*Disclaimer: There is no ongoing development of SamCoin. Any funds you send will be used towards a Waverunner. We will send you SamCoin, though. If you support SamCoin and we are able to buy a Waverunner, we'll let you use it. We will send you SamCoin based on it's current valuation\*\* and SamCoin holders will be invited to ride the Waverunner!

\*\*Disclaimer: The valuation is completely determined by us.
